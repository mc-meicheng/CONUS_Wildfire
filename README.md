# CONUS_Wildfire
How does LULCC influences climate and thus wildfire activities across CONUS? 

This is a class project for the physical geography seminar (year 2019). 

In this project, the WRF model is run to simulate the 10-year climate with current and future LULC data published online. 

With the model output, several wildfire indices are calculated. 

Then, we analyze how LULCC influences the duration and intensity of wildfire activities across CONUS.

This repository focuses on data analysis with model outputs.
